**Thoracoscopic Training VR** is an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) simulation platform designed for thoracoscopic surgery training. Utilizing advanced soft-body simulation techniques, particularly Extended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD), this platform offers a cost-effective and accessible solution for training thoracic surgery residents in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) techniques.

### Key Features

*   **Realistic Soft-Body Simulation**: Implements XPBD to accurately model the behavior of lung tissue during surgical procedures.
*   **VR Integration**: Developed for Meta Quest 2, providing an immersive training experience.
*   **Real-Time Interaction**: Offers immediate visual and haptic feedback for realistic surgical tool-tissue interactions.
*   **Customizable Training Scenarios**: Includes various exercises designed to progressively enhance soft-body manipulation skills.
*   **Performance Evaluation**: Incorporates a comprehensive system for assessing and providing feedback on trainee performance.

### Technical Details

*   **Simulation Framework**: Uses a particle-based system with constraints to model deformable objects.
*   **Mesh Generation**: Employs tetrahedral meshes refined using Delaunay techniques for volume preservation.
*   **Unity Integration**: Seamlessly integrates the simulation into the Unity environment for real-time execution.
*   **Data Collection**: Records simulation data in CSV format for detailed analysis and validation.

### Experimental Results

The platform was evaluated in collaboration with thoracic surgery residents at the University of Turin. The study demonstrated:

*   Improved performance across tasks of varying complexity.
*   Positive feedback on the system's usability, realism, and educational value.
*   Potential for enhancing surgical skills in a risk-free environment.

Paradox! is a fast-paced, single-screen puzzle platformer that requires planning, logical thinking and quick reflexes. Play as an eccentric scientist stuck in the past after clumsily breaking his time machine, and collaborate with your younger self to return to the present!

Play in the past, then help yourself from the future. Paradox! lets you travel through time, breaking the rules of traditional puzzle platformers to create a challenging, yet rewarding adventure where every level is played twice: then, and now!

### Play Every Level Twice!

In the first phase, you play as the sprightly young professor. Your task is to collect all the scattered time crystals while dodging deadly lasers, navigating vanishing platforms, and racing against a ticking clock that threatens to erase you from existence. Strangely, it seems someone is helping you by manipulating the environment...

The second phase reveals the twist, you must now play as your older, wiser and rather crankier self! Your job is to manipulate the environment, ensuring your younger self's success in a paradoxical partnership. You must guide your past self to collect all the time crystals and escape each level before the time runs out.

Be wary: danger lurks around every corner! If you slip up and the professors touch each other,you'll be erased from existence! Thankfully, you have a tricked-out cane stick and sick rollers to gain an edge against the relentless march of time.

### Still not sure?

Here's what else Paradox! has in store:

* BRAIN-TEASING LEVELS packed with obstacles that will test your wits and reflexes!
* BONUS CHALLENGES and UNLOCKABLES for dedicated time travelers!
* COLOSSAL BOSSES itching to wipe you from the timeline!

### Ready to Bend Time?

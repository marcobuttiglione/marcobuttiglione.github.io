### Description

**Paradox!** is a single-screen puzzle platformer that explores the concept of "single-player co-op." The core mechanic requires the player to complete every level twice: first as a character in the past, and then as a character in the future. The second run happens simultaneously with the recording of the first run, requiring the player to manipulate the environment to ensure their past self succeeds. It combines logical planning with reflex-based platforming in a time-bending narrative.

### Contributions

As the **Game Director and Lead Developer**, I led the project from the initial prototype to its current commercial development phase. My key responsibilities included:

*   **Core Mechanics Design:** Conceptualized and refined the "time-loop" mechanic, balancing the difficulty between the platforming execution and the puzzle-solving logic.
*   **Game Architecture & Character Controller:** Designed the software architecture and implemented the character controller to ensure precise movement and platforming feel.
*   **Rewind & Replay Logic:** Engineered the core time-manipulation system that records player inputs and replays them deterministically, enabling the "single-player co-op" gameplay.
*   **Team Leadership:** Managed a team of 7, overseeing task distribution, art direction consistency, and the production roadmap towards the Steam release.

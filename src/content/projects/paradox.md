**Paradox!** is a fast-paced, single-screen puzzle platformer that requires planning, logical thinking and quick reflexes.

Play as an eccentric scientist stuck in the past after clumsily breaking his time machine, and collaborate with your younger self to return to the present!

Every level is played twice: first as the young professor collecting time crystals, and then as your older self manipulating the environment to ensure your younger self's success.

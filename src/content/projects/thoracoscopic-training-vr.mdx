**Thoracoscopic Training VR** is an innovative Virtual Reality (VR) simulation platform designed for thoracoscopic surgery training. Utilizing advanced soft-body simulation techniques, particularly Extended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD), this platform offers a cost-effective and accessible solution for training thoracic surgery residents in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) techniques.

The system implements XPBD to accurately model the behavior of lung tissue during surgical procedures, providing realistic soft-body simulation. Developed for Meta Quest 2, the platform offers an immersive training experience with immediate visual and haptic feedback for realistic surgical tool-tissue interactions. It includes various customizable training scenarios designed to progressively enhance soft-body manipulation skills, along with a comprehensive system for assessing and providing feedback on trainee performance.

From a technical perspective, the simulation framework uses a particle-based system with constraints to model deformable objects, employing tetrahedral meshes refined using Delaunay techniques for volume preservation. The simulation is seamlessly integrated into the Unity environment for real-time execution, and records simulation data in CSV format for detailed analysis and validation.

The platform was evaluated in collaboration with thoracic surgery residents at the University of Turin. The study demonstrated improved performance across tasks of varying complexity, with positive feedback on the system's usability, realism, and educational value, highlighting its potential for enhancing surgical skills in a risk-free environment.

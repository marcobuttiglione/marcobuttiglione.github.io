### Description

**Thoracoscopic Training VR** is a Virtual Reality simulation platform developed as part of my **Master's Thesis in Computer Science and Engineering**. It is designed to train thoracic surgery residents in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS), addressing the need for accessible, risk-free training tools by simulating realistic soft-tissue behavior without the high costs of traditional physical simulators.

Developed for **Meta Quest 2**, the system utilizes **Extended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD)** to accurately model the physical properties of lung tissue. It features a custom particle-based physics engine that handles deformable objects, volume preservation, and collision detection in real-time. The platform provides immediate visual and haptic feedback, allowing trainees to practice complex surgical maneuvers and soft-body manipulation in a controlled environment.

The simulator includes a suite of training scenarios with increasing difficulty and a built-in assessment system that tracks performance metrics. A validation study conducted with residents at the University of Turin demonstrated the system's effectiveness in improving surgical skills and its high perceived realism.

### Description

**CubeSnake** is a modern 3D twist on the classic Snake arcade game. Players must slither across the floors and walls of a cubic environment, collecting food to grow while avoiding their own tail. With a simple two-button control scheme for turning left and right, the challenge is to survive the endless loop and climb the global leaderboards.

### Collaboration

This project was a collaboration between **Kabum** and **Rewind Studios**. My contribution focused on the final release phases, providing development support to the launch. I specifically worked on the Input/Output systems to refine the control responsiveness and implemented key components of the User Interface (UI).

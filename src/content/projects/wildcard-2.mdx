### Description

**Wildcard 2.0** is a Virtual Reality application designed to enhance attention skills in individuals with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD). Developed during the **"Advanced User Interfaces"** master's course at **Politecnico di Milano**, this project combines the immersive nature of VR with **eye-tracking technology** to create novel interactions for cognitive rehabilitation.

The application was designed to address attention deficits common in NDD conditions (such as Intellectual Disability, ADHD, and ASD). By exploiting eye-tracking, the system allows for more precise monitoring and training of visual attention, offering an engaging environment that encourages consistent practice, a critical factor for effective rehabilitation.

### Validation & Recognition

The system was validated through a four-week experimental study involving 38 participants at the **Fraternità e Amicizia - Soc. Cooperativa Sociale Onlus**. The study demonstrated the application's usability and its effectiveness in improving Visual Attention Skills.

This research received the **Best Paper Award** at the **HCII 2024 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction**.

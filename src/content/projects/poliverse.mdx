### Description

**Poliverse** is a **standardized starter kit** and framework developed during my PhD to streamline the creation of research and thesis projects. By providing a pre-configured environment based on open standards like **OpenXR** in **Unity**, it eliminates the initial technical overhead, allowing students and researchers to focus immediately on their specific contributions rather than setting up complex VR/AR systems from scratch.

To further enhance usability and testing, the ecosystem is structured as an interactive **Metaverse city**. This design organizes diverse research activities into a cohesive virtual world where projects are contextually placed—such as medical simulations within a virtual hospital or training modules inside a school. This spatial organization not only facilitates seamless transitions between different experiences but also simplifies the exhibition of multiple projects during live demos and events.

### Key Goals

*   **Accelerated Development:** Drastically reduces setup time for thesis students by providing a robust, ready-to-use foundation.
*   **Unified Ecosystem:** Ensures all projects share a common architecture, making it easier to maintain, integrate, and present different research outputs in a single environment.
*   **Seamless Demonstration:** Designed to facilitate the exhibition of multiple projects during events like the **Politecnico di Milano Open Day**, providing a continuous and context-aware user experience.

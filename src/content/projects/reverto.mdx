### Description

**Reverto** is a specialized VR/AR framework focused on **multi-user collaborative medical training**. Building upon the architectural concepts of [Poliverse](/projects/poliverse), it creates a seamless, persistent virtual environment designed to simulate hospital wards and operating rooms for educational purposes.

The platform enables multiple users—instructors and residents—to interact simultaneously within the same virtual space, facilitating mentorship and collaborative learning regardless of physical location.

The platform currently hosts specialized training modules, including:
*   **Thoracoscopic Training:** A dedicated module for simulating thoracoscopic surgical procedures, featuring realistic **lung tissue simulation** powered by **XPBD** (Extended Position-Based Dynamics).
*   **Ultrasound Simulation:** A realistic ultrasound simulator that generates diagnostic imagery from **CT scans** (Computed Tomography), simulating sound wave propagation to produce realistic 2D ultrasound views.

### Field Testing

The system has been successfully deployed and tested during **two editions** of a specialized training course for **thoracic surgery residents** at the **Molinette Hospital** in Turin. This close collaboration allows for the collection of **quantitative data** and direct **user feedback**, which are essential for iteratively improving the platform and validating its training effectiveness.

### Key Features

*   **Collaborative Training:** Enables synchronous interaction between instructors and residents, allowing for real-time supervision and cooperative surgical procedures.
*   **Advanced Simulation:** Incorporates high-fidelity technologies like **XPBD** for soft-tissue physics and **CT-based** rendering to ensure medical realism.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Unifies diverse training modules into a single, persistent virtual hospital, eliminating the fragmentation typical of standalone simulators.
